**Deeplink Tester: Privacy policy**

Hey, check out this Android appâ€”Sanjay Gupta built it and threw the code up on GitHub with an MIT license. You can also snag it on Google Play.

As a fellow Android enthusiast, privacy is a big deal to me. Hate it when apps swipe your data without a heads-up.

Just so you know, I haven't set up this app to grab any of your personal info. Everything, including the app deep link you create, hangs out only on your device. If you ever want to nix it, just clear the app's data or uninstall it.

No need to ask for permission to use this app. Enjoy!

Yours sincerely,
Sanjay Gupta
Noida, India.
